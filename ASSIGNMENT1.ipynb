    "Explain with an example each when to use a for loop and a while loop\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    For loops and while loops are both control structures in programming that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. Here are some examples to demonstrate when you might use each one:\n",
    "\n",
    "For loop: When you know the number of iterations beforehand and want to iterate through a sequence of elements, such as a list or an array. For example, you have a list of names and you want to print each name:\n",
    "    \n",
    "names = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"David\"]\n",
    "for name in names:\n",
    "    print(name)\n",
    "    \n",
    "While loop: When you don't know the number of iterations beforehand, or you have a condition that needs to be met before you stop looping. For example, you want to keep prompting the user for a password until they enter the correct password:\n",
    "It's important to note that if the condition for a while loop is never met, the loop will run forever, creating an infinite loop. On the other hand, for loops are safer because they have a defined number of iterations.\n",
    "password = \"secret\"\n",
    "input_password = \"\"\n",
    "while input_password != password:\n",
    "    input_password = input(\"Enter your password: \")\n",
    "print(\"Access granted.\")"
